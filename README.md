# SpaceWire Commutator
The main goal of the project is the processing and routing of SpaceWire packets using the simplest switch model as an example.

The program runs in 5 console windows at the same time (2 receivers, 2 sources and a router) on Linux OS.
The data in the package is randomly generated in a specific format.
Full information you can get by contacting me by email.
